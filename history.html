        <h1>The History of Casio</h1>

        <div class="history-body">
            <p>Casio is often associated with affordable digital watches, but its story begins far from the wrist. The company was founded in Japan in 1946 by Tadao Kashio, an engineer driven by a belief that technology should improve everyday life through practicality, not luxury. That philosophy would later become the backbone of Casio's identity.</p>

            <p>Casio's first major success was not a watch, but a calculator. In the 1950s and 60s, the company focused on electronic calculation, developing compact and reliable devices at a time when such technology was still rare and expensive. This background in electronics deeply shaped Casio's approach when it entered the watch industry.</p>

            <p>In 1974, Casio introduced the Casiotron, its first wristwatch. It was revolutionary for its time: a digital watch with an automatic calendar that accounted for different month lengths. From the beginning, Casio watches were not designed to imitate traditional timepieces. Instead, they treated the watch as an electronic instrument — precise, logical, and functional.</p>

            <p>Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Casio embraced experimentation. Calculator watches, databank models, world timers, and musical alarms were not gimmicks, but expressions of what digital technology could offer on the wrist. Casio watches became symbols of a future-oriented mindset, where usefulness and innovation mattered more than status.</p>

            <p>The 1980s also marked the birth of one of Casio's most important creations: G-Shock. Designed to survive extreme conditions, G-Shock redefined durability in watches and challenged the idea that a timepiece had to be delicate. Its success reinforced Casio's reputation for engineering-first design and real-world toughness.</p>

            <p>Despite trends shifting toward luxury and mechanical craftsmanship, Casio never abandoned its core principles. Simplicity, reliability, long battery life, and accessibility remained central. Many Casio models stayed in production for decades with minimal changes, proving that good design does not need constant reinvention.</p>

            <p>Today, Casio watches are worn by collectors, professionals, students, soldiers, and everyday users around the world. Some models are celebrated icons, others humble tools — but all reflect the same idea: technology should serve the user quietly and effectively.</p>

            <p>Casio's history is not about prestige or exclusivity. It is about honest design, functional innovation, and the belief that a well-made watch can be affordable, durable, and timeless.</p>
